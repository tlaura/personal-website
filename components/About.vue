      <p class="about-description">
        Iâ€™m a software engineer, currently based in London, looking to pursue a
        career in full-stack development, to further develop my capabilities in
        the latest web and mobile technologies.
        <br /><br />
        After graduating from the University of Birmingham, I worked in finance
        and consulting in international businesses based out of New York. Having
        progressed quickly, I made the decision to leave the world of finance
        and make a career change into the multifaceted environment of
        technology.
        <br /><br />
        I recently completed an advanced coding bootcamp (Progmasters), where I
        thrived under the pressure of constantly learning new technologies and
        solving complex problems.
        <br /><br />
        My main technologies are
        <strong>Python, Java Spring, VueJS </strong> and
        <strong>Angular</strong>.
