      <p class="about-description">
        Iâ€™m a software engineer based in London, looking to pursue a career in
        full-stack development.
        <br /><br />
        Having graduated from the University of Birmingham, I then worked in
        client facing roles in finance and consulting out of New York.
        <br /><br />
        In 2019, I made the decision to move into technology and have now
        completed an advanced coding bootcamp (Progmasters). I have experience
        in
        <strong>Python, Java Spring, VueJS </strong> and
        <strong>Angular</strong>.
