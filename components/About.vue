        Iâ€™m a software engineer based in London, looking to progress in a
        fast-moving, collaborative environment.
        <br /><br />
        Having graduated from the University of Birmingham, I then worked in
        client facing roles in finance and consulting out of New York.
        <br /><br />
        In 2019, I made the decision to move into technology and have since
        gained experience as a full-stack developer at a fintech trading firm
        and currently at a global software consultancy.
        <br /><br />
        My key skills:
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>Infrastructure: <strong>AWS, Azure</strong></li>
          <li>Backend: <strong>Python, Java</strong></li>
          <li>Frontend: <strong>React, VueJS</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  </SplitLayout>
